<h2>Body Copy</h2>
<p>I and the artilleryman, seated on the step of the drinking fountain, made a very passable meal upon what we had brought with us. Patrols of soldiers--here no longer hussars, but grenadiers in white--were warning people to move now or to take refuge in their cellars as soon as the firing began.  We saw as we crossed the railway bridge that a growing crowd of people had assembled in and about the railway station, and the swarming platform was piled with boxes and packages. The ordinary traffic had been stopped, I believe, in order to allow of the passage of troops and guns to Chertsey, and I have heard since that a savage struggle occurred for places in the special trains that were put on at a later hour.</p>
<p>We remained at Weybridge until midday, and at that hour we found ourselves at the place near Shepperton Lock where the Wey and Thames join.  Part of the time we spent helping two old women to pack a little cart.  The Wey has a treble mouth, and at this point boats are to be hired, and there was a ferry across the river.  On the Shepperton side was an inn with a lawn, and beyond that the tower of Shepperton Church--it has been replaced by a spire--rose above the trees.</p>
<p>Here we found an excited and noisy crowd of fugitives.  As yet the flight had not grown to a panic, but there were already far more people than all the boats going to and fro could enable to cross. People came panting along under heavy burdens; one husband and wife were even carrying a small outhouse door between them, with some of their household goods piled thereon.  One man told us he meant to try to get away from Shepperton station.</p>

<p>There was a lot of shouting, and one man was even jesting.  The idea people seemed to have here was that the Martians were simply formidable human beings, who might attack and sack the town, to be certainly destroyed in the end.  Every now and then people would glance nervously across the Wey, at the meadows towards Chertsey, but everything over there was still.</p>
<p>Across the Thames, except just where the boats landed, everything was quiet, in vivid contrast with the Surrey side.  The people who landed there from the boats went tramping off down the lane.  The big ferryboat had just made a journey.  Three or four soldiers stood on the lawn of the inn, staring and jesting at the fugitives, without offering to help.  The inn was closed, as it was now within prohibited hours.</p>

<p>Small Copy</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; cried a boatman, and &ldquo;Shut up, you fool!&rdquo; said a man near me to a yelping dog.  Then the sound came again, this time from the direction of Chertsey, a muffled thud--the sound of a gun.</p>

<p>The fighting was beginning.  Almost immediately unseen batteries across the river to our right, unseen because of the trees, took up the chorus, firing heavily one after the other.  A woman screamed. Everyone stood arrested by the sudden stir of battle, near us and yet invisible to us.  Nothing was to be seen save flat meadows, cows feeding unconcernedly for the most part, and silvery pollard willows motionless in the warm sunlight.</p>

<h2>Blockquote</h2>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need them. You are learning something every day. A baby has brains, but it doesn&rsquo;t know much. Experience is the only thing that brings knowledge, and the longer you are on earth the more experience you are sure to get.</p>

    <li>The very thought of parting with the faithful fellow caused me so great regret and genuine sorrow that I put it off until just before we arrived at the city&rsquo;s gates; but then, finally, it became imperative that we separate</li>
    <li>Had nothing further than my own safety or pleasure been at stake no argument could have prevailed upon me to turn away the one creature upon Barsoom that had never failed in a demonstration of affection and loyalty; but as I would willingly have offered my life in the service of her in search of whom I was about to challenge the unknown dangers of this, to me, mysterious city, I could not permit even Woola&rsquo;s life to threaten the success of my venture, much less his momentary happiness, for I doubted not he soon would forget me</li>
    <li>And so I bade the poor beast an affectionate farewell, promising him, however, that if I came through my adventure in safety that in some way I should find the means to search him out</li>
    <li>He seemed to understand me fully, and when I pointed back in the direction of Thark he turned sorrowfully away, nor could I bear to watch him go; but resolutely set my face toward Zodanga and with a touch of heartsickness approached her frowning walls</li>
